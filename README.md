## Overview of the analysis:

In this Analysis, we will be using Javascript as the primary coding language, which has been designed to enhance HTML.It's the backbone of many popular visualization libraries, such as Plotly, and is often used to create custom dashboards. JavaScript also provides a high level of customization: the dashboards built to deliver visual data, such as maps or graphs, can be as simple or complex as needed.

To be successful in this module, we'll apply HTML and Bootstrap skills and have an open mind regarding semicolons.

### The purpose of the analysis:
In this Project:
      We will build a table using data stored in a JavaScript array. 
      We will create filters to make this table fully dynamic, meaning that it will react to user input, and then place the table into an HTML file for easy viewing.
      We will customize your webpage using Bootstrap, and equip your table with several fully functional filters that will allow users to interact with our                   visualizations.
